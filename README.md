# Integrating Wavelet-Joint Learning and eXtreme Gradient Boosting with Graph Memory (WJXGM): Advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Complex Decision-Making

## Abstract
This study introduces the **Wavelet-Joint Learning eXtreme Gradient Boosting with Graph Memory (WJXGM)** model, a novel framework in deep reinforcement learning aimed at addressing complex decision-making challenges. The WJXGM model integrates **wavelet-based feature extraction**, **joint learning mechanisms**, **extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)**, and **graph memory augmentation** to enhance learning efficiency and decision accuracy in dynamic environments.

Wavelet transformation is applied for effective feature extraction from raw data, capturing essential time-frequency characteristics. The joint learning mechanism enables the model to simultaneously learn multiple related tasks, improving learning efficiency. XGBoost enhances decision-making in scenarios with a multitude of variables and outcomes. Graph memory effectively processes and utilizes complex relational data, improving long-term dependency handling.

Experimental results show that WJXGM outperforms existing deep reinforcement learning models across complex tasks characterized by high-dimensional data and intricate decision dynamics. The WJXGM model has significant applications in areas such as autonomous systems, financial modeling, and strategic planning, marking a new benchmark for AI-based decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.

### 3.2 Wavelet Transformation for Feature Extraction
Wavelet Transform decomposes a signal \(x(t)\) as:

\[
CWT_{\psi}(x)(a, b) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|a|}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) \psi^* \left(\frac{t - b}{a}\right) dt
\]

where \(a\) and \(b\) are scale and translation parameters, and \(\psi\) is the wavelet.

XGBoost is integrated to optimize decision-making processes by building incremental decision trees and enhancing prediction accuracy.

### 3.5 Graph Memory Incorporation
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) process relational data:

\[
H^{(l+1)} = \sigma \left( \text{AGGREGATE}\left( H^{(l)}, A \right) \right)
\]

where \(H\) represents node features, \(A\) is the adjacency matrix, and \(\sigma\) is an activation function.
